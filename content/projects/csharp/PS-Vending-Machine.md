This was my final project for my Human Computer Interaction course during my undergrad.

This is a simulation of a touch screen vending machine for PS4 games.
Use the left and right arrow keys to simulate swiping left and right in the new release category.
Use the up and down arrow keys to simulate swiping left and right in the popular category.
Once you choose a game you scroll down to view more info about the game and be able to add it to your cart.
To open the menu click on the icon on the top left of the screen.
When you open your cart from the menu you can remove games from the cart / wishlist by clicking on the game.
