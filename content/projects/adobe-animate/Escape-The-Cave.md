+++

This was the final project of my multimedia course during my undergrad.
The game is a 2D platformer where the player needs to escape the cave using ladders without getting out of screen.

We had to create a game design document for the game and every level should introduce a new game mechanic.

The levels are represented by a 2D array where each value represents a tile.

## Game Design Document

### Goal of the Game

The player has to follow the path created by the pickups to reach the end of the level.
