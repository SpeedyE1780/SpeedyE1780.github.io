This was the first project of my multimedia course during my undergrad.
The game has a character selection menu and two game modes.

- **Classic:** The player has 3 lives and must collect all of the falling characters.

- **Arcade:** The player's character is part of a team either heroes or villains. Catching player from your team raises your score and player from the opposing team will reduce your score. It has 3 power ups:

  - **Time:** Adds time to the game timer.

  - **Double Score:** All character give double points.

  - **Double Size:** The player's character will double in size.

The game has a settings menu where the player can change the player's speed, game duration, drop speeds, etc...
