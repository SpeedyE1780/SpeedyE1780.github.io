## The Guarden [(Repo)](https://github.com/SpeedyE1780/TheGuarden)

The Guarden is a tower defence game with the addition of farming and life-sim elements ([trailer](https://youtu.be/N34Xm_W78WA?si=On6DiZABzu72Ts9E)).

The project used an event based approach and modular data using scriptable objects inspired from the [Unite 2017](https://youtu.be/raQ3iHhE_Kk?si=lUgMKNJBqtC3jOXA) and [Unite 2016](https://youtu.be/6vmRwLYWNRo?si=dsWtos6RE9MD6Gk0) talks.
