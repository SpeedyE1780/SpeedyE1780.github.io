This a mobile game I developed as a freelancer.
I integrated multiple firebase services:

- Real-time Database: store player's information and leader board.
- Cloud Storage: store the game's files (ex: skins).
- Remote Config: modify the prices in the store.
- Authentication: authenticate the player.
- Cloud Messaging: send notifications.
- Cloud functions: update the leader board.
