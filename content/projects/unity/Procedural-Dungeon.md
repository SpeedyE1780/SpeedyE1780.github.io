## Procedural Dungeon [(Repo)](https://github.com/SpeedyE1780/Procedural-Dungeon)

This is project generates dungeon procedurally using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm [(Demo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_nJrFur_cA).
It uses two different approaches Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search to generate different looking dungeons.
The BFS approach leads to a dungeon that is more connected while DFS leads to a more linear dungeon.
