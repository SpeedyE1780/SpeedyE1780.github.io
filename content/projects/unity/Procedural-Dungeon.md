This is project generates dungeon procedurally using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm.
It uses two different approaches Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search to generate different looking dungeons.
The BFS approach leads to a dungeon that is more connected while DFS leads to a more linear dungeon.
