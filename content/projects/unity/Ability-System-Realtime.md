This is an ability system demo where each player attacks each other in realtime.
This was a rework of the turn-based ability system I did for the job interview.
The player regenerates stamina every second that allows him to cast an ability.
Every ability uses an activator to active the ability.
The activators and abilities are represented by scriptable objects.
