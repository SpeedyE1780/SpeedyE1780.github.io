This was my second project for my computer games design course during my undergrad.
This is a third person shooter game where the player needs to escape from a zombie infested hospital.
There are multiple types of weapons and zombies.
The player has a flashlight that will help him escape the dark lit hospital.
Weapons are found on the hospital floor.
