This was my major project for my postgraduate.

The PCG Library is made up of the C++ DLL library that can be used with C++ and other languages by using the C DLL.

This library can currently be used with C#, Unity, Unreal and Python.

A REST API is available to use the library with languages not yet implemented.

The library can be previewed using the web app.

Code documentation is generated with doxygen.

A manual documentation is created using asciidoc.
