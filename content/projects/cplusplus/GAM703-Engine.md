+++

This a C++ Open GL game engine I developed for my Digital Games Technology course during my postgraduate.
It uses CMake to handle linking and compiling all targets and 3rd party libraries.

It has a simple game demo where you must capture enemies with a lower power level(represented by their color).
The enemy AI follows seek/flee behavior based on the player's power level.

The engine's documentation is generated with doxygen.
