+++

This was my first project of my intro to artificial intelligence course during my undergrad.

The aim of the project is to implement an AI that plays Tic Tac Toe. The AI should implement both the Minimax algorithm as well as the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.  
The file TicTacToe.py, made available with the assignment has the skeleton for the project. Make sure to read and understand the code before you start implementing.  

**Objective:** At the end of this project, the user must be able to play against the computer in one of 3 modes:

- A purely random player (already implemented)

- An AI player using the Minimax algorithm (partially implemented)

- An AI player using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning
